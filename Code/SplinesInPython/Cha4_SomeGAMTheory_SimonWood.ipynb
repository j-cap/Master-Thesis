    "For simplicity of presentation, only one very simple type of penalized regression smoother was presented in Chapter 3. For practical work a variety of alternative smoothers are available, and this section introduces a useful subset of the possibilities, starting with smooths of one covariate, and then moving on to smooths of one or more covariates. Since all the smooths presented are based on splines (although the tensor product smooths need not be), the section starts by addressing the question: what’s so special about splines?"

    "In practice, then, choice of basis dimension is something that probably has to remain a part of model specification. However, it is important to note that the exact size of basis dimension is really not that critical. The basis dimension is only setting an upper bound on the flexibility of a term: it is the smoothing parameter that controls the actual effective degrees of freedom. Hence the model fit is usually rather insensitive to the basis dimension, provided that it is not set restrictively low for the application concerned. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only caveat to this point is the slightly subtle one, that a function space with basis dimension 20 will contain a larger space of functions with EDF 5 than will a function space of dimension 10 (the numbers being arbitrary): it is this fact that causes model fit to retain some sensitivity to basis dimension, even if the appropriate EDF for a term is well below the basis dimension.In practice, the modeller needs to decide roughly how large a basis dimension is fairly certain to provide adequate flexibility, in any particular application, and use\n",

    "##### 4.1.8 Tensor product smooths\n",
    "\n",
    "A major feature of the TPS/TPRS approach is the isotropy of the wiggliness penalty: wiggliness in all directions is treated equally, with the fitted spline entirely invariant to rotation of the co-ordinate system for the predictor variables. This isotropy is often considered to be desirable (especially as a smooth function of geographic co-ordinates), but comes with some disadvantages, e.g. the difficulty of knowing how to scale predictors relative to each other, when they are measured in fundamentally different units. One pragmatic approach is to scale all predictors into the unit square. A more satisfactory approach uses *tensor product smooths*. \n",

    "**Tensor product bases** \\\n",
    "The basic approach of this section is to start from smooths of single covariates, represented using any basis with associated quadratic penalty measuring 'wiggliness' of the smooth. From these <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">'marginal smooths' a  tensor product construction</span>  is used to build up smooths of several variables. See de Boor (1978) for an important early reference on tensor product spline bases.\n",

    "As example, a smooth function of 3 covariates $x, z$ and $v$ is constructed (in general this can be done with an arbitrary number of covariates). The process starts by assuming that we have low rank bases available, representing smooth functions $f_x$, $f_z$ and $f_v$. That is\n",
